      "Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help! Fever is a temporary increase in your body temperature, usually caused by an infection or illness. It's a natural response of the immune system to fight off the infection. Symptoms can include high fever, shivering, sweating, headache, and fatigue. In rare cases, it can lead to more severe complications like organ damage or brain inflammation.\n",

      "Question : How many days it takes to recovr from fever?\n",

In general, most people can recover from a mild fever within 3-5 days, while more severe cases may take longer to recover, up to 14 days or more. It is important to monitor the patient's condition and seek medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen over time.\n",

Some of the most common ones include Cafergot, naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan (Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt), and zolmitriptan (Zomig).

Generally, it can take 1-3 days for the body to eliminate half of the nicotine, and up to 2 weeks to fully eliminate it.
